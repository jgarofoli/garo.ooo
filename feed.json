It&rsquo;s all suffering and adversity, almost too much. If you can get past that, then it took 2/3 of the book to get going.

I am suspicious of the closed ecosystem being able to sustain for that long. But I don&rsquo;t know enough about ecology to be any more than that about it, so I&rsquo;ll leave that one there. Or how come there aren&rsquo;t problems with diseases in the later parts of the story; you&rsquo;d think separate populations would generate different strains of viruses and when they meet it would be bad for one or both. Where is the underground/black market economy? It really stuck out as something missing from the world to me.

Things like, this is a mirror of our current times (most writing usually is), intra- and inter- nation-state-wise, and how would I arrange a society to function in such isolation, and this is really just a different setting for the same problems and ideas of one of those generation ship scifi stories, isn&rsquo;t it? I had a lot of &ldquo;how could this be different&rdquo; thoughts to many plot points and story choices as I read, I should keep notes on those for the next book I read.</p>\n",

In the end, I think this story was more of a cartoon depiction than a live action staging.\n\nAll that being said, I'm curious how the author arranged all this to exist, which I think is in the first sequel.\n\nMaybe later I will elaborate on the more constructive thought provoking ideas that I had while reading the book. Things like, this is a mirror of our current times (most writing usually is), intra- and inter- nation-state-wise, and how would I arrange a society to function in such isolation, and this is really just a different setting for the same problems and ideas of one of those generation ship scifi stories, isn't it? I had a lot of \"how could this be different\" thoughts to many plot points and story choices as I read, I should keep notes on those for the next book I read.\n",

I&rsquo;m looking for more context in this area. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why did progressive taxation and the welfare state become the chosen option beginning around 1915? What events lead to that conclusion? I don&rsquo;t find &ldquo;because World War 1&rdquo; to be sufficient. It must have been a long road leading up to that.</li>\n<li>How did the free movement of capital around 1980 come about? Also, there are consequences of this globalization, and I want to have a firmer grasp on the connection between this cause and effect.

I'm looking for more context in this area. In particular:\n\n* Why did progressive taxation and the welfare state become the chosen option beginning around 1915? What events lead to that conclusion? I don't find \"because World War 1\" to be sufficient. It must have been a long road leading up to that.\n* How did the free movement of capital around 1980 come about? Also, there are consequences of this globalization, and I want to have a firmer grasp on the connection between this cause and effect. It really seems to be a defining frame for so many issues in the world; is that true?\n* And at the same time, circa 1980, the decline of progressive taxation. Was is the same fundamental forces? And no wonder our infrastructure is poorly maintained and failing: we built it all in an entirely different budgetary situation. (Edit: added this one)\n* Generally more of a connection between the historical context and the basically economic story that Piketty tells here. I would really like to compare the events that are emphasized by different authors in the same time periods.\n* Exploring the conceptions of private property as a concept for common good.

Just like the source I linked to <a href=\"https://garo.ooo/2022/07/03/i-added-how.html\">last</a>, I’m going to do an advert for this post. It’s really great.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Because I haven’t found a better way to make this point in my own words for you, I’m just going to quote his first section heading: “Good writing is pointing out.” There’s a lot more helpful explanation in that section.

I’m doing it right now.</li>\n<li>He’s got some words about knowing when to stop. This didn’t resonate with me at first, but it does now. I think I’ve still got a lot more processing to do on this particular lesson. I’ll be coming back to it.</li>\n<li>Finally, Oliver reminds us that writing doesn’t really start with a blank page.

I don’t know if it is helpful for everyone. It is helpful for me.</p>\n<p>So, what’s the revised plan?</p>\n<p>Before I get to that, I want to connect this bit about not starting from a blank page to some other things that I’ve read this year.</p>\n<p>The same book that Burkeman mentions, How to Take Smart Notes by Ahrens has a lot of useful practical advice on writing. He is writing about academic texts, but it applies lots of places I think. Ahrens also talks about not starting from a blank page, start from your notes of what you have been reading. But how? I’ll be honest, as practical and helpful as Ahrens’ prescription is, it still didn’t make sense to me.</p>\n<p>Later I read <a href=\"http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/mc/WriteThinkLearn.pdf\">some slides</a> (edit: link added) about practical epistemology. The author talks about not only how to go about forming beliefs that are both more correct and less wrong. He also makes some suggestions about how to write, since writing is a great way to get feedback from yourself on your own writing. Honestly it was very similar to Ahrens’ advice, but slightly different. It’s a good set of slides. Like I said, I’ll add the link.</p>\n<p>The penultimate (thus far) connection was some things that are the Bullet Journal Method book. There are a lot of really good, practical, tips in that book. If it seems like something that might work for you, I really suggest you take a longer look at it. Go grab the library copy and browse through it. The thing I want to highlight here is the sprints. I’ve used sprints before because work. But I’ve never run my own sprints. And I’ve never run my own sprints for my own projects at home on myself. That’s what we’re doing to try here.</p>\n<p>Quick aside: there is a whole mess of other relevant things in that book too. But I’m going to omit that stuff for now. Just know that it wasn’t only the idea of sprints that was helpful here.</p>\n<p>The last connection was Burkeman&rsquo;s article.</p>\n<p>So this is the plan. First, since I haven’t been very good collecting post ideas I’m going to jump start that. Well, since it took a bit to finish writing this, that part has already happened. Second, I’m going to take one of those ideas and work on it for an hour. Not finish and publish it, because I don’t know when it’s done.

This is the mini sprint to jump start the flywheel. Last, it’s just not credible that I will be publishing daily anymore. I have a full time job, and other stuff, and a daily blog is just more than is realistically achievable. Often, hopefully more than once a week, but, well, as the sub-title of the blog says, no promises.</p>\n<p>Let me summarize the plan again.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On day 1 of the sprint, spend an hour brain dumping out all the ideas for blog posts I can think of.

Hopefully those ideas that I’ve generated in step 1 can be used for developing future blog posts and research. But I’m not sure how soon they’ll be ready.

The mask is near the center of the wall of the dining area next to the door to the kitchen. It is placed at the height of top of the kitchen doorway.

These aren't limited to the very first sentence in the piece, it could be the beginning sentence in the chapter or segment too. The goal is to look at a bunch of them, pick some personal favorites, and determine why they work.\n\nI won't reproduce my list in entire. These aren't even my favorites, just ones that I wanted to comment on.\n\n< epigraph pre=\"Herman Melville\" cite=\"Moby-Dick\" link=\"//micro.blog/books/9780393285000\" >\nCall me Ishmael.\n< /epigraph >\n\nI wonder what is the speaker's true name.

It's been fun.\n- I'm a competent photographer 📷, it's a hobby that I enjoy but have been doing less of it lately.\n- I like to cook, I'll probably share pictures from time to time. Maybe some recipes too.\n- I'm pretty math curious, so things like that might show up from time to time.\n- I went to school for science, physics in particular. So, I have some experience in that.\n- I do some software professionally, so I know a bit about that.\n\nObviously there is more than that, but this probably covers a lot ground that we could use to make a connection. Let's try to get acquainted!\n",
